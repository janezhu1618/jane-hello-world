I discovered a great sale on AE jeans! Non-clearance AE jeans have $10 discount automatically applied in cart.

I found a pair of [ankle-length, high-waisted jeans][jeans] for $19.97. With the $10 discount on jeans and a 20% student discount (yes, I still get student discounts from [Unidays][unidays] ðŸ˜‚), the total was $5.99 + tax for me. If you don't have the coupon, the price is $9.97, and that is still a steal for a pair of AE jeans!

I chose free in-store or curbside pickup for free shipping. Otherwise, there is free shipping on orders over $50. Happy couponing!
